A customizable text-based survival engine where players or teams compete until one winner remains.  
The simulation uses weighted RNG to trigger Healing, Damage, or Flavor events  
read dynamically from external files (healmessages.txt, damagemessages.txt, miscmessages.txt).  
Features include automatic player elimination, turn-based "Nights," and support for both Solo and Team modes.  
  
Note: Developed for Windows (Visual Studio).
